# Math-and-Programming
I (@ahammadshawki8) and my friend (@Arko07-quanta) co-authored this book. It has little bit of math and little bit of programming. But we have described the relation between math and programming broadly in this book. It is very helpful for programming beginners and math lovers.

This book is currently under construction.

# Some proposals for writing the book:
1. Use nice pictures
2. Speak frankly. Don't  be too formal. Try to start a section with a small story of your life or any relevant  story of mathematician life. For example, "A famous mathematician was come to this idea while he was....."

# Basic layout
## Fonts you need
	Georgia
	Siyam Rupali
	Kalpurush 

## Page setup
    Page size = statement(5.5'-8.5')
    Page margins = custom_margins(top="2cm" other="1.5cm")

## Chapter
    Chapter number = (Siyam Rupali, 10, bold, left aligned)
    Chapter name = (Siyam Rupali, 14, bold, left aligned)
    paragraph spacing = 0
    1 line gap

## Quote
    Quote = (Georgia, 10, right aligned)
	Speaker = newline(Georgia, 10, right aligned)
    1 line gap

## Section
    spacing = before(6), after(6)
    use the icon
    name = (Siyam Rupali, 11, bold, left aligned)

## Body
    (Kalpurush, 10pt, justify aligned)
    24-28 lines in a page
    new topic, new paragraph
    spacing = before(0), after(6)
    each paragraph starts with tab (8 space)

## Problem/Exercise/Examples/Special-Instructions
    For problems inside of body use box, copy it from the template
	For problems after each chapter you do not need to use box
	
    problem_title = (Siyam Rupali, 9pt, bold)
	problem body = (Default, Kalpurush, 10pt)
    spacing = before(10), after(10)

## GitHub link/Programming
    copy the box from template
    use link icon
    (Default, Kalpurush, 10)

    In programming, 
        comment = italic

## Pictures
    Use caption after each tables and plot
    Use png pictures or white background
    Make it greyscale using the color option of format tab

## Footnote
    Try to avoid
    (Kalpurush, 9)

## Header/Page Number
    Don't need to include.
    I will include.
